# Nuby

A simple Ruby-like language, compiler, and virtual machine, written in Ruby

## What?

This is a small educational project to make:

* A simple stack-based bytecode virtual machine
* An assembler to compile assembly language to bytecode for the VM
* A compiler to compile a simple Ruby-like language (Nuby) to VM assembly
* A spec for the source language Nuby

## Why?

I've been working through the book [Language Implementation Patterns][lipbook] by [Terrence Parr][parrt], implementing some of the patterns (to some level of thoroughness) in Ruby. My efforts are in my [language\_implementation\_patterns][liprepo] repository.

I got as far as the virtual machine implementation patterns before deciding I'd like to try making a full compiler pipeline.

## Notes

Run `rake guard` and `rake bundle` to use 1.9.3 where necessary. It doesn't look like _rb-fsevent_ works in Rubinius right now:

    âžœ  nuby  irb
    require 'rubinius-2.0.0rc1 :001 > require 'rb-fsevent'
     => true
    rubinius-2.0.0rc1 :002 > require 'listen'
     => true
    rubinius-2.0.0rc1 :003 > Listen.to(".", filter: /\.rb$/) { |m, a, r| puts "Listen:"; p m; p a; p r }
    Errno::EBADF: Bad file descriptor - select(2) failed
